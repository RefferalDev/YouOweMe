# Contribution Guide
This mono repo is open source, so feel free to take it apart, and go bonkers
with it üê±‚Äçüèç.

Each service of the product is nicely seperated into its 
own folders as a effect of the mono-repo paradigm.

But if you wish for your idea to land on the app, submit a proposal in the form of
an [Issue](https://github.com/preetjdp/YouOweMe/issues/new?assignees=&labels=New+Idea&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BNEW+IDEA%5D)
and lets percolate on it.

# Tech Stack
These are the set of services currently being used for the product.
* [Flutter - Mobile App](https://github.com/preetjdp/YouOweMe/tree/master/mobileApp "Mobile App Section")
* [Firebase - Database and Serverless Functions](https://github.com/preetjdp/YouOweMe/tree/master/firebase)

# Navigating the Codebase
The Codebase is a single
[monorepo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos "What Are MonoRepo's")
consisting of all the infrastructure required to run the services, nicely organised
and placed in its own folders with kick ass documentaion <sup> [2](#Citations) </sup>.
